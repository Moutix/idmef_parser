name: System
description: 'The System class describes a system or network involved in an event.
  The systems or networks represented by this class are categorized according to the
  role they played in the incident through the category attribute.  The value of this
  category attribute dictates the semantics of the aggregated classes in the System
  class.  If the category attribute has a value of "source", then the aggregated classes
  denote the machine and service from which the activity is originating.  With a category
  attribute value of "target" or "intermediary", then the machine or service is the
  one targeted in the activity.  A value of "sensor" dictates that this System was
  part of an instrumentation to monitor the network. '

    description: A mechanism by which to extend the data model.
attributes:
  restriction:
    name: restriction
    multiplicity: Optional
    type: ENUM
    description: This attribute is defined in Section 3.2.
  category:
    name: category
    multiplicity: Required
    type: ENUM
    description: 'Classifies the role the host or network played in the incident.  The
      possible values are:'
    values:
    - rank: '1'
      keyword: source
      description: The System was the source of the event.
    - rank: '2'
      keyword: target
      description: The System was the target of the event.
    - rank: '3'
      keyword: intermediate
      description: The System was an intermediary in the event.
    - rank: '4'
      keyword: sensor
      description: The System was a sensor monitoring the event.
    - rank: '5'
      keyword: infrastructure
      description: The System was an infrastructure node of IODEF document exchange.
    - rank: '6'
      keyword: ext-value
      description: An escape value used to extend this attribute. See Section 5.1.
  ext-category:
    name: ext-category
    multiplicity: Optional
    type: STRING
    description: A means by which to extend the category attribute.  See Section 5.1.
  interface:
    name: interface
    multiplicity: Optional
    type: STRING
    description: Specifies the interface on which the event(s) on this System originated.  If
      the Node class specifies a network rather than a host, this attribute has no
      meaning.
  spoofed:
    name: spoofed
    multiplicity: Optional
    type: ENUM
    description: An indication of confidence in whether this System was the true target
      or attacking host.  The permitted values for this attribute are shown below.  The
      default value is "unknown".
    values:
    - rank: '1'
      keyword: unknown
      description: The accuracy of the category attribute value is unknown.
    - rank: '2'
      keyword: 'yes'
      description: The category attribute value is probably incorrect.  In the case
        of a source, the System is likely a decoy; with a target, the System was likely
        not the intended victim.
    - rank: '3'
      keyword: 'no'
      description: The category attribute value is believed to be correct.
